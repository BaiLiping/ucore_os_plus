# RustOS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wangrunji0408/RustOS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wangrunji0408/RustOS)

Rust port for uCore OS, supporting x86_64 and riscv32i.

## Summary

This is a project of THU Operating System (2018 Spring) && Comprehensive Experiment of Computer System (2018 Summer).

Project wiki (internal access only): [OS](http://os.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/oscourse/OS2018spring/projects/g11), [CECS](http://os.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/oscourse/csproject2018/group05)

The initial goal is to write a mini OS in Rust with multi-core support. More specifically, it would start from the post of the [Writing an OS in Rust](http://os.phil-opp.com) series, then reimplement [xv6-x86_64](https://github.com/jserv/xv6-x86_64) in Rust style.

In fact, it's more complicated than we expected to write an OS starting from scratch. So by the end of OS course, we only finished rewriting [ucore_os_lab](https://github.com/chyyuu/ucore_os_lab), without multi-core support. Then as a part of [CECS project](https://github.com/riscv-and-rust-and-decaf), we ported it from x86_64 to RISCV32I, and made it work on our FPGA CPU.

## Building

### Environment
